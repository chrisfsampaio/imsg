## Common problems
###Using special characters:
If you wanna use special characters like parentheses, brackets or quotes you need to escape it. i.e.:
```bash
$ imsg HELLOOO FROM TERMINAL \(ESCAPIIING\)
```
or
```bash
$ imsg "HELLOOO FROM TERMINAL (ESCAPIIING)"
```

###Not having write permissions:

If you don't have write access to your Ruby folder:

```bash
$ sudo gem install imsg
```
