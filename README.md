# imsg

Tired of getting off your terminal screen to answer those dickhead friends of yours?  
Now you can curse them right from the terminal!

## Installation

It is easy as:

```bash
$ gem install imsg
```

## Requirements
Mac OS X (will not work on other unix/linux)

## Usage

```bash
$ imsg HELLOOO FROM TERMINAL
```

Then select a number corresponding to the person you wish to message

    To which chat you wanna send your message?
    (You can choose a number or type a buddy name/email)
    1 - Christian Sampaio
    2 - Linus Torvalds
    3 - Tim Berners Lee
    4 - Steve Wozniak
    5 - Sergey Brin
    6 - Larry Page
```bash
$ 4
```

## Common problems
###Using special characters:
If you wanna use special characters like parentheses, brackets or quotes you need to escape it. i.e.:
```bash
$ imsg HELLOOO FROM TERMINAL \(ESCAPIIING\)
```
or
```bash
$ imsg "HELLOOO FROM TERMINAL (ESCAPIIING)"
```

###Not having write permissions:

If you don't have write access to your Ruby folder:

```bash
$ sudo gem install imsg
```
